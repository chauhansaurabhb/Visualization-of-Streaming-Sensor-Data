# Visualization-of-Streaming-Sensor-Data
This project represents good falvour of IoT as well as Data Visualization.This project contains three module, First module(JavaSED1) 
generates simulated temperature sensor value which is used by second module(JavaSED2) to store continuously generated temperature value 
to database(MySQL) .Third module provides support for Visualization, to provide real time visualization we used node.js, that priodically fetch data
from database(MySQL) and display on browser.
